# Challenge 1: Boolean
# Create a variable a and set it equal to true
a = true
# Create a variable b and set it equal to false
b = false
# Write a statement using a and b that evaluates to false
puts a == b 
# Write a statement using a and b that evaluates to true
puts b != a 

# Challenge 2: Nil
# p the value of the variable to the terminal
im_nil = nil
# puts the value of the variable to the terminal concatenate the string "nil was here".
puts "#{im_nil} was here"
# print the value of the variable to the terminal
puts im_nil
# puts the class of the value of the variable to the terminal. Use the .class method. Look up this method on Google.
puts im_nil.class

# Challenge 3: Integers
# Create a variable d and set it equal to a Fixnum
d = 5
puts d
# Create a variable e and set it equal to a Float
e = 5.5
puts e
